// most common events in JS
// In order for JavaScript to handle an event, we first need to tell it to listen for that event. 
// We do this by calling the addEventListener() method on the element we want to add the listener to, and passing it two arguments:

// the name of the event to listen for, and
// a callback function to "handle" the event


// example of addEventListener
const input = document.getElementById('input');
input.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('I was clicked!');
});
// Now when you click inside of input#input, you will get an alert box.

// Let's review what's happening in this code.

// First, we grab the element that we want to add the event listener to and save a reference to it in the input variable.

// Next, we call addEventListener() on that element to tell JavaScript to listen for the event. 
// We pass two arguments to addEventListener(): the name of the event to listen for (in this case, click) and a callback function that will be executed when the event is "heard."


// another way of doing it
const input = document.getElementById('input');

function clickAlert() {
  alert('I was clicked!');
}

input.addEventListener('click', clickAlert);
